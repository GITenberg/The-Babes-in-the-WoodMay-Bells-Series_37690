<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A gentleman of good account<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In Norfolk dwelt of late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who did in honor far surmount<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Most men of his estate.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sore sick he was, and like to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No help his life could save;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wife by him as sick did lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And both possessed one grave.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No love between these two was lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Each was to other kind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In love they lived, in love they died,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And left two babes behind.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The one, a fine and pretty boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Not passing three years old;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other, a girl more young than he,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And framed in beauty's mould.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The father left his little son,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As plainly doth appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he to perfect age should come,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Three hundred pounds a year.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And to his little daughter Jane,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Five hundred pounds in gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be paid down on her marriage-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which might not be controlled:<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But if the children chanced to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ere they to age should come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their uncle should possess their wealth;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For so the will did run.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now, brother," said the dying man,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Look to my children dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be good unto my boy and girl,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No friends else have they here:"<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And up bespake their mother dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"O, brother kind," quoth she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You are the man must bring our babes<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To wealth or misery."<br /></span>

<span class="i1">When you are laid in grave."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The parents being dead and gone<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He had not kept these pretty babes<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A twelvemonth and a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, for their wealth, he did devise<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To make them both away.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He bargained with two ruffians strong<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He told his wife an artful tale:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To be brought up in fair London,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With one that was his friend.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Away then went those pretty babes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Rejoicing at that tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoicing with a merry mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They should on cock-horse ride.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They prate and prattle pleasantly,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As they rode on the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those that should their butchers be,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And work their lives' decay.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So that the pretty speech they had,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Made murder's heart relent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they that undertook the deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Full sore did now repent.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet one of them, more hard of heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Did vow to do his charge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the wretch that hired him,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Had paid him very large.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The other won't agree thereto,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So here they fall to strife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one another they did fight<br /></span>
<span class="i1">About the children's life.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he that was of mildest mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Did slay the other there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within an unfrequented wood:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The babes did quake for fear.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He took the children by the hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Tears standing in their eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade them straightway follow him,<br /></span>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
